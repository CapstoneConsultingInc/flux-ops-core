# ops-core
This repo contains the core logic related to operations automation. This example shows only one `src` subdirectory containing scripts to manage flux. The intent would be for this repo to contain several subdiretories, where each contains scripts for managing a particular component. i.e. k8s clusters, or the various applications deployed via flux. Each would contain a subdirectory of scripts focused on the given component.
